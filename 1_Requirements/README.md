# BRAKEING SYSTEM
## INTRODUCTION:
To incorporate control engineering using CAN protocol in STM Microcontrollers and implement the same in BRAKEING subsystems under the Electrical and Control Engineering domain through teleoperation mode. It helps the system to run automatically and aslo with error check. 

## OBJECTIVES:
a) To build a system that can receive input and generate automatically output in easy way and short time.

b) To build a monitoring system that is able to monitor and manage all operations efficiently.

c) Give an opportunity to drivers to reduce mistakes that always happen during manual method.


## BENEFITS:
a) Record Maintenance.

b) Saves Time and Cost.

c) Secure and Reliable.

e) Increases Efficiency.

f) Simple and Easy to Use.

## 4W'S and 1H:

### Who
This BRAKEING System can be used in any electric vehicles and those who want their vehicle to be autonomous. 
### What:
BRAKING System is a software and hardware that helps to run the vehicle automatically without manual control.
### When:
This can be used under any critical times or when a man does not want to drive but want to reach his place.
### Where:
These are getting implemented worldwide and can be used as utility vehicle for seamless and safe transport in and around.

### How:
To detect a potential collision and activate the braking system to decelerate the vehicle with the purpode of avoiding a collision,or atleast mitigating its impact.0

## Swot Analysis:
### Opportunities:

The BRAKEING system of most vehicles is an MDPS system. An MDPS system reduces a driver’s effort by providing assist force and return force  using an electric motor. In addition, it is possible to maintain the stoping automatically, and drive autonomously using the MDPS system.

### Threats:

a) Self-driving cars could be hacked with ransomware, not allowing owners to enter, start or exit the vehicle until a ransom is paid.

b) Terrorist hackers could disable networks, range sensors and cameras, resulting in multiple collisions.

c) An autonomous vehicle’s operating system could be hacked, exposing personal information on other connected devices.

d) Hacked vehicles could potentially be rerouted to an area where a robbery or assault is planned.

e) Connected cars can control IoT devices at home, giving hackers access to people’s home computer networks.
### Strengths:
a) Simple & Easy to Use.

b) Increased automation Engagement.

c) Efficient  Management.

d) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 


### Weakness:
a) The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.

b) Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity.

c) Risk of computer virus.
